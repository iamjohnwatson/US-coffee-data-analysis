# US Coffee Consumption Analytics

## Overview
This repository contains the R code and analysis for exploring American coffee consumption trends. The analysis includes insights into the preferred location for coffee consumption, age-based patterns, home brewing methods, roast preferences, purchasing locations, and global coffee consumption. The project utilizes data analytics skills with the R programming language.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from a survey and taste test conducted by British YouTuber James Hoffman. It includes responses from over 4,000 participants, focusing on various aspects of coffee consumption, including preferences, habits, and demographics.

## Setup
To reproduce the analysis, you need to have R and RStudio installed on your machine. The required R packages/libraries are specified in the libraries section of the R Markdown file.

Analysis Highlights
